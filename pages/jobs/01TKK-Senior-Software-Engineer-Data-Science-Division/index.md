The Government Data Science Group finds ways to use software and data to change the way government operates and improve the lives of Singaporeans. This includes everything from building better frontend applications for citizens, to improving the internal operations of public agencies. We believe that digital technology can not just improve the efficiency of public sector operations, but dramatically improve the way citizens interact with their government. Current projects we are working on include:

* Data.gov.sg - An open data portal to provide public access and understanding of Singapore's government data
* Beeline - An express bus service aimed at optimizing commute times and reducing traffic using public transport data
* An investigation into using blockchains in our public records

As a Senior Software Engineer, you will lead the design and development of both these and other new public projects. This means helping to identify good potential areas where we can use software to help improve the lives of the public. You will need to design the overall system architectures and lead a team of software engineers to build it. This also means beyond writing code you will help establish coding standards and mentor other developers.

* Strong programming skills, ability to write clean and readable code and experience in developing highly useable digital products are more important than formal educational qualifications.
* Experience with front-end development (eg. HTML5, CSS, Javascript), server-side web development (eg. Python, PHP, Ruby on Rails) and databases (eg. PostgreSQL, MongoDB). Deep expertise in one of these areas and familiarity with the others is preferred.
* Willing to lead and teach other developers
* Passion for the use of technology to improve public services and citizen experiences.
* A get-things-done attitude and willingness to learn from other team members in a multi-disciplinary team is important.
* Degree or Diploma in Computer Science, Computer or Electronics Engineering, Information Technology or related disciplines.
* Experience from working in a start-up environment is a bonus.

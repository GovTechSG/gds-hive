The Government Digital Services (GDS) Team aims to spearhead the digital transformation of government. Government Platform-as-a-service (PaaS) is an initiative in that direction bringing a new approach to application designs, development and deployment. This Agile, Open and Cloud-enabled Application Infrastructure will provide the government with a modern IT platform that accelerates software development without compromising operations and security. Our objective is to catapult our government infrastructure into the new digital era with faster time to market, operational agility, automated deployment and scaling.
